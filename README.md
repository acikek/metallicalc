# metallicalc

A calculator written in Rust

## About

This project was inspired by [HasKalc](https://github.com/nekodjin/HasKalc), a calculator written in Haskell. I decided to challenge myself in a few areas I'm not particularly well-versed in: Rust and algorithms.

## Installation

Install with cargo:
```sh
cargo install metallicalc
```

## Usage

Run the `metallicalc` command from a terminal of your choice.

**Note**: The Windows `cmd.exe` is not fully supported. There may be broken color codes should you decide to use it.
